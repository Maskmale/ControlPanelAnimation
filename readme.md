## Control Panel Interactive Animation

Continue the topic ["Interactive Animations"](https://www.objc.io/issues/12-animations/interactive-animations/), objc.io talked two years ago. When the article was released(just before WWDC2014 and iOS 8), a key question can't be resolved by UIView Animation. Two authors of the article implement the above interacitive animation in two ways: UIKit Dynamics, and spring animation effect implemented by CADisplayLink, latter is admirable.

[WWDC 2014 Session 236: Building Interruptible and Responsive Interactions](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2014/236/) explains how to bulid fluid interactive animations. There are three transition problems to resolve:

1. Animation to Gesture
2. Gesture to Animation
3. Animation to Animation

Almost two weeks ago, [Session 216: Advances in UIKit Animations and Transitions](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/216/) introduces [UIViewPropertyAnimator](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiviewpropertyanimator) in iOS 10 to make completely interactive, interruptible animations.  

I implement above animation in two ways:

1. UIView Animation/Core Animation: after iOS 8, it's very easy to achieve the goal; on iOS 7, there is a little limitation that UIView Animation is not additive until iOS 8 and Spring Core Animation is not public until iOS 9.
2. UIViewPropertyAnimator: it's awesome and its usage is very like UIView Animation API. It's very flexible, and relatively complex, not a little. 

## Requirements

1. Control-Panel-Interactive-Animation: iOS 8+, Swift 2.2+
2. iOS10-Control-Panel-Interactive-Animation: Xcode 8 beta, iOS 10+, Swift 3

## View Controller Transition

Before iOS 10, view controller transition is not completely interactive, interruptible, for example, push and pop in UINavigationController: if start transition in non-interactive, youâ€™ll have to wait until the transition animation is finished before you can do anything; if start transition in interactive, after interaction end, the transition animation is no more interactive. 

iOS 10 introduce the protocol `UIViewImplicitlyAnimating`, which `UIViewPropertyAnimator` conform to, into view controller transition protocol which is very complex now. Actually, with the help of `UIViewPropertyAnimator`, we can simplify view controller transition protocol.
